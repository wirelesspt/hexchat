 * wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wirelesspt/hexchat/master/hexchat_otr-deb_setup.sh
 * chmod +x hexchat_otr-deb_setup.sh ; ./hexchat_otr-deb_setup.sh

# TODO
* Better OTR support

# Wish list:
* Builtin Tor bundle

# NOT TO DO
* Bother with Microsoft Spyware OS version. The OS defeats the purpose of OTR.
