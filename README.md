This script will automatically install and or update hexchat and otr on gnu debian and gentoo linux based distros like:

gentoo, pentoo, sabayon, funtoo, mint, debian, ubuntu, kali

Turns insecure private messages automatically into off the record encrypted conversations once a query is started 


# To install on debian, ubuntu, mint, kali based distros that use sudo, copy and paste:

 * wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wirelesspt/hexchat/master/hexchat_otr-deb_setup.sh
 * chmod +x hexchat_otr-deb_setup.sh ; ./hexchat_otr-deb_setup.sh

# To install on gentoo, pentoo, sabayon, funtoo based distros that use sudo, copy and paste:

 * wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wirelesspt/hexchat/master/hexchat_otr-src_setup.sh
 * chmod +x hexchat_otr-src_setup.sh ; ./hexchat_otr-src_setup.sh

# TODO
* Better OTR support
* Tor hidden services support
* Hexchat hardening
* Updated server list

# Wish list:
* Builtin Tor bundle

# NOT TO DO
* Bother with Microsoft Spyware OS version. The OS defeats the purpose of OTR.
